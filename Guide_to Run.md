# Steps to Run Code

## 1. Web Scraping for News Headlines

- Run `news Headlines_Webscrapping.ipynb` to scrape Economic Times website for news data.
- Make sure to install the Beautiful Soup library using `pip install beautifulsoup4`.

## 2. Merging Data

- Execute `merging_data.ipynb` to merge the dataset collected from the NSE website for Nifty50 data and the scraped news data.
- The Nifty 50 dataset is named `NIFTY50.csv`, and the code will generate a CSV named `output.csv`.

## 3. Fine Tune BERT Model

- Run `LLM_Project_Training.ipynb` on Google Colab to fine-tune the BERT model.
- Install the Transformers library using `pip install transformers`.
- For pretraining, use the dataset `all-data.csv` containing financial news headlines and their respective sentiments.
- The pre-trained model will be saved on Google Drive.

## 4. BERT Inference

- Execute `BERT_Inference.ipynb` to perform sentiment analysis on the pretrained BERT model and update the CSV files by adding a feature of sentiment to the dataset.

## 5. Train and Test the ML Model

- Use `Machine_Learning_Model.ipynb` to train and test the machine learning model.
- The code includes two case studies for verification.

Make sure to follow the order mentioned above for smooth execution of the code.
